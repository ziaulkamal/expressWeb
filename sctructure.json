The EU said the contracts, which Google used to sell adverts on third-party websites, broke EU anti-trust rules by restricting publishers from placing ads from Google's competitors on their sites. Google said it would appeal against the decision. The company was hit with a record €2.42bn fine in June 2017 over its shopping search service. It was also fined €4.34bn in 2018 over the way it used its Android mobile operating system to cement the dominance of its search engine.",
